# HTML Advanced Project

## Project Overview
This project is part of the **HTML Advanced** series. The goal of this project is to implement a fully semantic HTML webpage based on a designer file from Figma. While the structure is complete in HTML, styling (CSS) will be applied in the next project.

You will work with sections including **Header**, **Banner**, **Quote**, **Videos**, **Membership**, **FAQ**, and **Footer**. All assets like images and logos are extracted from the Figma design.
